MID-BOOTCAMP PROJECT


README

The main goal if this project is to predict the results of the offer_accepted column. 

______________________________________________________________________________

To achive that, I started cleaning the data and creating a Logistic Regression Model. Due to the pronounce class imbalance the model doesn't have much use. After applying SMOTE to the variables, the outcome wasn't much better.

That is why I focused on identifying the main indicators of acceptance rate, that can be found in slides folder. 

This slides don't show any predictions to anticipate the respondance of the customers, but can help to understand which customers can be of more interest for the company in the pursuit of rising acceptance rate.
